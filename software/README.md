## Software

Arduino RGB LED PCB firmware because nothing but Adafruit's NeoPixel library would work properly with the SK6805 LEDs. Someday I will port this to PlatformIO.

For the time being, you'll need to install SpenceKonde's megaTinyCore and the Adafruit_NeoPixel library in Arduino. Set the MCU clock speed to 16MHz.
