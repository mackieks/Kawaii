# Hardware

The top-level MCAD assemblies in F3D and STEP format are the main reference for the overall build. STLs for the 3D-printed components are provided for convenience.

## PCB Ordering Specs:

- Dock: 1mm, ENIG recommended, electropolished stencil, [Mouser Cart](https://www.mouser.com/Tools/Project/Share?AccessID=a96e376ba1)
- kawaiiSD: 0.6mm, electropolished stencil and jig, [Mouser Cart](https://www.mouser.com/Tools/Project/Share?AccessID=177a5d7398)
- riser: 0.8mm
- rgb: 0.6mm, electropolished stencil

## List of Kawaii components:
- [x] CNC machined, anodized, and laser-etched aluminum shell (two pieces)
- [x] Hollywood-2 Wii Mini OMEGA trim, [AVEflex](https://github.com/mackieks/AVEflex), [nandFlex](https://github.com/mackieks/nandFlex), and [Thundervolt](https://github.com/mackieks/thundervolt)
- [x] Internal kawaiiSD PCB
- [x] Pogo pin riser PCB
- [x] RGB LED PCB
- [x] MHF4 female pigtails [link](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256802754472981.html)
- [x] 3D-printed lightpipes (x2)
- [x] 12-pin magnetic pogo pin connector [link 1](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256804525551011.html), [link 2](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256807252344568.html)
- [x] Various fasteners (see MCAD)

## List of dock components:
- [x] 3D-printed dock (three pieces)
- [x] Dock PCB (including four trimmed/cleaned-up Wii GCC ports)
- [x] LED lightpipe (PLPC2-100)
- [x] Various fasteners (see MCAD)

## Miscellaneous assembly/usage notes:
- [x] A heavily-undervolted Hollywood-2 Wii Mini is mandatory. A Hollywood-1, or any variant at stock voltages, will run way too hot
- [x] Unless you live in Alaska or Siberia, the unit will need an external source of airflow (fan, AC, open window, etc.) to stay cool enough to touch during operation
- [x] Use 0.5mm foam tape to secure the RGB LED PCB to the Kawaii shell
- [x] Use a file to post-process the Wii GCC ports. They have to be really uniform and square to fit into the shell properly (see thread)
- [x] Use a camcorder pinout 3.5mm-to-RCA cable for A/V. Check the schematic for pinout details. [link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08V1SV8BL)
- [x] Use a Samsung / LG pinout 3.5mm-to-component cable for YPbPR. Check the schematic for pinout details. [link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09ZJTZ5NL)
